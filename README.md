# üå± Ra√≠zXP ‚Äì Personal Growth & Motivation Tracker

**Ra√≠zXP** is a personal gamification system designed to help you stay focused, motivated, and emotionally regulated while working toward your goals ‚Äî whether you're job hunting, building habits, or trying to stay grounded in difficult times.

This project was born from my own need to manage energy, emotions, and progress in a way that typical productivity apps couldn't offer me. So I built it ‚Äî first with Streamlit, now evolving into a full web app.
